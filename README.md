I developed a fully interactive Bank Customer Churn Analytics Dashboard using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly to visualize customer behavior, understand churn drivers, and support data driven decision making.

The project involved cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing a real world bank dataset of 10,000 customers across multiple countries. I engineered a user-friendly dashboard that provides deep insights into customer demographics, financial behavior, and churn patterns using dynamic filters and advanced visualizations.


 Core Objectives

The goal of this project was to:
	•	Understand why customers leave (churn)
	•	Identify high-risk customer segments
	•	Analyze country level and gender level differences
	•	Examine financial behavior influencing churn
	•	Enable decision makers to explore insights interactively

 Data Cleaning & Preparation

I performed complete data cleaning in Python:
	•	Removed duplicates and invalid records
	•	Standardized column names
	•	Handled missing values
	•	Converted categorical fields into usable formats
	•	Prepared the dataset for analytics

This ensured accurate, trustworthy insights throughout the dashboard.

Dashboard Features

The Streamlit dashboard includes five main analytical sections, each providing a different business perspective:

1. Overview

A high-level summary of the customer base, including:
	•	Total customers
	•	Average credit score
	•	Average balance
	•	Gender distribution
	•	Customer distribution by country

 2. Churn Insights

Focused on understanding customer attrition:
	•	Overall churn rate
	•	Churn by gender and country
	•	Behavioral patterns of customers who left vs stayed

 3. Financial Behavior Analysis

Advanced visual exploration of financial metrics:
	•	Balance distribution
	•	Salary vs balance relationship
	•	Impact of products and account activity

 4. Customer Segmentation

A multi-level segmentation using:
	•	Country
	•	Gender
	•	Churn status
	•	Tenure and financial variables

Includes a sunburst chart and a treemap to identify key customer profiles.

 5. Correlation & Heatmap Analysis

A detailed heatmap to uncover:
	•	Relationships between credit score, age, balance, products owned, salary,                                        and churn. 
            •     	Hidden patterns driving customer behavior


 Interactive Filters

The dashboard includes intuitive filters that allow for custom exploration:
	•	Country
	•	Gender
	•	Churn status
	•	Credit score range
	•	(Expandable to age, balance, and tenure)

These filters update the entire dashboard in real time, giving stakeholders the ability to drill into specific customer segments.

 Business Impact

This project provides actionable insights for business leaders, such as:
	•	Identifying high-risk customer groups
	•	Prioritizing retention efforts
	•	Understanding financial behaviors linked to churn
	•	Making informed decisions on product offerings
	•	Strengthening customer value management strategies

The dashboard supports strategic decision-making by transforming raw data into clear, interactive visuals.

Technical Stack
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Streamlit)
	•	Interactive visualizations using Plotly Express
	•	Real-time analytics dashboard built in Streamlit
	•	Deployment ready for cloud hosting (Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face)
